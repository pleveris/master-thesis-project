Note about extended dataset: this work is in-progress. This dataset is not yet fully prepared to be run and used and production environments.

Webservices for this new dataset are functioning, and are taken from public APIs list (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).
It would be worth considering to add the ability to specify which public sources should be used for the web service analysis.
Quality attributes are analyzed in a variety of ways, by measuring the response time by opening the URLs within a browser, or using other evaluation techniques provided by a Wireshark (https://wiki.wireshark.org/Tools).
The results in this dataset are most likely to change, by adding or including more evaluation criterias. Therefore, it is not advised using this dataset in the current workflow (at least for now).
